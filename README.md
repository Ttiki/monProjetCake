# [University] Cake PHP project

This project was made for the course "Conception applications internet" (Web apps conception). This course is available for the third year CS bachelor degree at UPPA.<br/>
This project is the final project for this course and was main to make us develop a website using the CakePHP framework by following the given instructions.
We had to learn the whole CakePHP framework by ourselves because there were no explanations on the given instruction nor do we had a lesson to follow and help us.


## Why this repo

Why this repo? Well, just like all the other university projects repos on my GitHub or over on the [Stonks Life Inc. organization](https://github.com/Stonks-Life-Inc), I made this repo as a _souvenir_ of this beautiful university years I've spent to this _marvelous and prestigious_ university.
